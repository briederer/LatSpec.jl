The uncertainties can either be numbers for symmetric uncertainties or a tuple for lower and upper bounds. It can be created by either providing positional arguments ( e.g. DataPoint(1.0,0.1,0.2) or DataPoint(1.0,(0.09,0.11),(0.21,0.19))) or using the keyword arguments stat and sys ( e.g. `DataPoint(1.0,stat=0.1,sys=0.2) . If only one uncertainty is provided without a keyword, it is assumed to be statistical.\n\nIt can also be created by using the ± symbol, e.g. x ± stat and x ± stat ± sys.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"api/#LatSpec.autocor-Tuple{Any, Any}","page":"API","title":"LatSpec.autocor","text":"autocor(x,lag)\n\nReturns autocorrelation function for a distance of lag, i.e. between values of x[t] and x[t+lag].
